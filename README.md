# Go_Interpreter! #

I am writing a Go interpreter with the help of *Thornsten Ball's* book *Writing and Interpreter in Go*

- Using this project to learn Go and brush up on the skills i learned in Compilers, and Programming Languages.
- This project will eventually become a Go Compiler (Compiler written in Go)
